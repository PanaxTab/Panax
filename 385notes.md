## What are the qualities or characteristics that the internet possesses and how do these distinguish the internet from preceding “old media”?

1. The internet is distinct from existing media forms in four key areas:
	* Interactivity
	* Interpersonal communication
	* User production of content, and
	* The individualization of media
2. Human technology interactivity
3. Interpersonal communication
4. Content production
5. Individualized media

## Comparison between Web 1.0 και Web 2.0:
* Web 1.0:
	* Read-only content
	* Static html pages
	* Users’ typical use of theinternet: mostly surfing the web
	* Users=consumers of information
	* Limited interaction (e.g. email, forms, chat)

* Web 2.0:
	* User-generated content
	* Users consume AND contribute with posting their own content(e.g. blogs, YouTube)
	* ser=consumer and producers ( “the read/write web”)
	* Open source software

* Web 3.0:
	* Web3.0 aims to satisfy users’ personal needs and to support individual navigation patterns
	* Smart, omnipresent
	* Semantic web (transforms information and data to useful content for the user)
	* Individualization(e.g. Google services with one login)
	* Ubiquitous computing (computing is made to appear anytime and everywhere, it can occur using any device, in any location, and in any format). It allows for devices communication.

* Internet of things(IoT): 
	* The network of devices, vehicles, and home appliances that contain electronics, software, actuators, and connectivity which allows these things to connect, interact and exchange data.


## Digital divide: 
	* An economic and social inequality to the access to, use of, or impact of information and communication technologies (ICT) including the internet
	* Age: e.g. Older people (65 years old and older)
	* Education: e.g. Primary school graduates
	* Geographical location: e.g. People living in under-developed countries or in remote locations
	* Socioeconomic class: e.g. Citizens of lower socioeconomic class

## Digital divide:
* Digital natives have never lived without a computer
* They were born after 1980 (or 1984, the year of the 8-bit video game) in the USA
* They were born after 1990 in Cyprus

* ***The argument for change***:
	* The idea that a new generation of students is entering the education system has excited recent attention among educators and education commentators.
	* Termed ‘digital natives’ or the ‘Net generation’, these young people are said to have been immersed in technology all their lives, imbuing them with sophisticated technical skills and learning preferences for which traditional education is unprepared.
	* Grand claims are being made about the nature of this generational change and about the urgent necessity for educational reform in response.
	* Digital natives learn differently compared to past generations of students. They are held to be
		* active experiential learners,
		* proficient in multi-tasking, and
		* dependent on communications technologies for accessing information and for interacting with others

## Digital Immigrants

* For those born prior to 1980 Prensky has coined the term ‘digital immigrants’(2001a). He claims that this section of the population, which includes most teachers, lacks the technological fluency of the digital natives and finds the skills possessed by them almost completely foreign.
* The disparity between the technological skills and interests of new students and the limited and unsophisticated technology use by educators is claimed to be creating alienation and disaffection among students.


## INTERNET AND SOCIETY

* Example of media literacy skills:
	* To understand:
		* Both how and why media messages are constructed, and for what purposes
	* To examine:
		* how individuals interpret messages differently
		* how values and points of view are included or excluded, and
		* how media can influence beliefs and behaviors

* Are the “digital natives” media-literate?
	* Today’s children, the “digital natives” are born in a technologically enriched environment, and can handle various media for communication to access information.
	* Children from a very young age have some basic media literacy skills, which are developed through their personal experiences with different media.

* The need to teach media literacy
	* Young children, even though they are digital natives and even though they are very capable with respect to using new technologies, are not necessarily media literate.
	* Therefore, there is a need to teach media literacy in schools.
